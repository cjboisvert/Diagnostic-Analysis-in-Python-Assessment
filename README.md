# Diagnostic-Analysis-in-Python-Assessment
This is the shared portion of my Module 2 Assessment in Python, in which I used (fake) NHS data to simulate a real-world analytical mandate.
The context assigned by LSE is as follows:
You are part of a team of data analysts that was contracted by the National Health Services (NHS), a publicly funded healthcare system in England. The NHS incurs significant, potentially avoidable, costs when patients miss general practitioner (GP) appointments. The reasons for missed appointments need to be better understood as explained by The British Medical Association (BMA) chair Professor Philip Banfield:

While it is frustrating when patients do not attend, the reasons why this happens should be investigated rather than simply resorting to punishing them. Financially penalising patients inevitably impact the poorest and most vulnerable in the community (GP Practice News 2022). 

Therefore, reducing or eliminating missed appointments would be beneficial financially as well as socially. The government needs a data-informed approach to deciding how best to handle this problem. At this stage of the project the two main questions posed by the NHS are:

Has there been adequate staff and capacity in the networks?
What was the actual utilisation of resources?
As you are new to Python, your role on the team is to get started with the data exploration, data wrangling, visualisations, and identifying possible trends in the data sets. For this, youâ€™ll investigate:

What is the number of locations, service settings, context types, national categories, and appointment statuses in the data sets?
What is the date range of the provided data sets, and which service settings reported the most appointments for a specific period?
What is the number of appointments and records per month?
What monthly and seasonal trends are evident, based on the number of appointments for service settings, context types, and national categories?
What are the top trending hashtags (#) on Twitter related to healthcare in the UK?
Were there adequate staff and capacity in the networks?
What was the actual utilisation of resources?
What possible recommendations does the data provide for the NHS?

# Diagnostic-Analysis-in-Python-Assessment
This is the shared portion of my Module 2 Assessment in Python, in which I used (fake) NHS data to simulate a real-world analytical mandate.
The context assigned by LSE is as follows:


You are part of a team of data analysts that was contracted by the National Health Services (NHS), a publicly funded healthcare system in England. The NHS incurs significant, potentially avoidable, costs when patients miss general practitioner (GP) appointments.
